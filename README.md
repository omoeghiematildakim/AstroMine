## Usage Examples

### Mining Operation Management

```javascript
// Initialize mining operation
const miningOp = await MiningOperation.create({
  asteroidId: "2021XD",
  equipment: {
    extractors: 3,
    processors: 2,
    storage: "500000 m3"
  },
  duration: "730 days",
  investmentCap: "1000 ETH"
});

// Start mining simulation
await miningOp.startSimulation({
  extractionRate: "100 m3/day",
  resourceFocus: ["platinum", "water", "rare-earths"],
  efficiency: 0.85
});
```

### Investment Management

```javascript
// Create investment pool
const pool = await InvestmentPool.create({
  operationId: miningOp.id,
  minInvestment: "0.1 ETH",
  maxParticipants: 1000,
  returnModel: "proportional"
});

// Process investment
await pool.invest({
  investor: wallet.address,
  amount: "5 ETH",
  duration: "24 months"
});
```

### Resource Trading

```javascript
// Place sell order
await market.createOrder({
  resource: "platinum",
  amount: "100 kg",
  price: "45000 DAI/kg",
  expiration: "24h"
});

// Execute trade
await market.executeTrade({
  orderId: "order123",
  amount: "50 kg",
  payment: {
    token: "DAI",
    amount: "2250000"
  }
});
